Todo:
    -   Trashcan that auto deletes after a week or so
    -   Match brace
    -   New line lists (after putting a "-", new lines will auto add one and indent)
    -   Figure out how to deal with conflicting filenames
    -   Replace data structures in TagListItem with LinkedHashMap/HashMap for faster lookup
    -   Multi-tags
    -   Encrypt database entries based on userID (and maybe the file name as well?)
    -   Code blocks?






    -   Decorators:
        - Local only
        - Pinned file





Future:
    Add a calendar that can sync with the notepad
    Home screen
