Todo:
    -   Trashcan that auto deletes after a week or so
    -   Match brace
    -   New line lists (after putting a "-", new lines will auto add one and indent)
    -   Local-only files (kinda done)
    -   Settings
    -   Saving window positions etc to json
    -   Finish search bar
    -   Keybinds
    -   Figure out how to deal with conflicting filenames
    -   Replace data structures in TagListItem with LinkedHashMap/HashMap for faster lookup
    -   Multi-tags
    -   Implement timer to auto-refresh the database every min or so
    -   Encrypt database entries based on userID (and maybe the file name as well?)






    -   Decorators:
        - Local only
        - Pinned file





Future:
    Add a calendar that can sync with the notepad
