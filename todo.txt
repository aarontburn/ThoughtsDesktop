Todo:
    -   Trashcan that auto deletes after a week or so
    -   Match brace
    -   New line lists (after putting a "-", new lines will auto add one and indent)
    -   Figure out how to deal with conflicting filenames
    -   Replace data structures in TagListItem with LinkedHashMap/HashMap for faster lookup
    -   Multi-tags
    -   Encrypt database entries based on userID (and maybe the file name as well?)
    -   Code blocks?
    -   Set minimum window size
    -   Move settings into main window, no need to have its own separate window




Home Screen:
    -   Show upcoming events and scheduleListItem for the current week is
    -   Hide/Show things based on screen size





Calendar:
    -   Setting to choose to end week with Sunday or Saturday
    -   Hide schedules without deleting them
    -   Shift-click events marks them as complete



Future:
    -   Make this a proper second-monitor application
        - Discord support?
        - Spotify/Music support (maybe make your own music player)
        - Application dock? maybe possible idk
            - Ability to "dock" windows inside the program, so it displays them inside Thoughts instead of its own window
